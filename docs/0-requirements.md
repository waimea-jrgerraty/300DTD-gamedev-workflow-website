# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

There is not a particular online tool that facilitates a task tracking workflow tailored for game development. Existing solutions are clumsy to use between multiple teams of specialised roles.

## End-User Requirements

The end users for this website are game studios and their employees. Specifically, this is made with the studio founded by a few people I know online in mind. These users are unhappy with their current solution which is Trello, as it is difficult effectively distribute tasks to different teams. The people who know how to 3D model do not want to be seeing each and every task related to programming. This has resulted in them having several very long task groups for different areas of work, which leads to a cluttered and unproductive workspace.
My specific end users have some other requirements. One of them suffers from colour blindness, so their input in design will be crucial for my solution to succeed. They also have a large google docs file for their game's story, which needs be seamlessly integrated into this solution.

## Proposed Solution

I intend to create a web application that allows users to create projects and invite other users to these projects. A project contains many tasks, which are organised into task groups and categories. Categories refer to areas of development, so someone specialising in one area does not have to see every task in an area they are not needed for. Creating a project will initialise it with some basic categories, such as Animation, Modelling, Programming, Writing. Within a category tasks will be in task groups

# Relevant Implications

## Accessability

Accessability implications involve ensuring my website is available to and usable for all end-users, regardless of their abilities.

### Relevance to the System

All users of this website need to be able to be able to use it with minimal difficulty; if parts of the site are not accessable for a user, (such as if they struggle with low-contrast text or colour blindness) they will seek other solutions. As this system targets a desktop application, this does not apply to mobile accessability.

### Impact / Considerations

To ensure my website meets the accessability requirements, I must ensure the website functions correctly on various desktop and laptop resolutions. Since the site is not targetting mobile support, that will be a lower priority. It would still be helpful to have a working (but potentially reduced) mobile interface, for cases where developers are messaged while away from their main device. As many of my users may have vision impairments, including myself, I must ensure the site remains easy to use under these conditions. To do this, I will ensure the following:
- The background and text should not have excessive contrast for a dark theme; for those with astigmatism such as myself, midnight themes cause halation around the white text making it harder to read. The bakground on my site will be a dark grey to minimise the effects of halation.
- Use a font with industry-respected readability for visually-impaired users.
- A suitable colour scheme should be chosen that works well for different types of colour blindness, such as using blue and red instead of green and red.
- Ensuring all UI components are appropriately sized and easy to navigate on different resolutions.



## Functionality 

The Functionality implication relates to *how well* my website works for its end users, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

### Relevance to the System

The website must be functional for my end users, regardless of their knowledge of each area of game-development. As it is a wide field that brings in programmers, artists, writers, and management, the site must meet each of their requirements. Each of these user groups need the UI to meet their needs for managing tasks between them.

### Impact / Considerations

Ensuring the functionality of my website will involve frequent testing from my end-users while refining the final product, to ensure each of their usage requirements are met. As I am a programmer, I do not know what features will be needed for writers or artists, so their input will be neccessary. The site also needs to be bug free and not feel clunky to use for it to work well for the end users.


## End-User Implications

End-User Implications are connected to the specific needs of my end-users.

### Relevance to the System

My end users have various degrees of ability in different aspects of game development, so I will need to consider how I can fullfill their specific needs while not confusing them with solutions for other users specific needs. As my target userbase is developers, the types of devices they will be using are desktops and laptops. 

### Impact / Considerations

To address end-user implications for my site, I will need to know a-lot about my end users, in terms of age, gender, and interst in order to design a suitable interface. My site will need to use language and content appropriate for the knowledge of my end users, including the tasks they generate. I can achieve this by separaing tasks into categories, so people knowledgable in one field don't have to see confusing terminology from users knowledgeable in another field. I will also need to ensure the site works on a range of desktop and laptop resolutions, and make regular use of user feedback in the design and implementation process. 



## Privacy

The Privacy implications of my website relate to protecting the privacy of my end users and their data.

### Relevance to the System

As this website deals with user accounts, I must ensure their sensitive account details like their password are properly encrypted to protect their credentials in the case of a data-breach. Since the projects generated by the users are not intended to be public, I need to ensure their projects are only accessable to invited users. Ideally, I would also encrypt the project data to protect from data-breaches, but I think that is outside the scope of this project.

### Impact / Considerations

This website will collect and use as little data from the user as is absolutely neccessary, and will only store that data if it is required. This means user accounts will only contain a username, password, optional "role" and optional image. (role is a premade list of roles related to game development). Checks will need to be in place to ensure the user can only see data when neccessary, such as restricting access to pages related to projects if you are not a member of that project. I will also need to abide by all privacy laws, such as the NZ Privacy Act 1993.
