# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

There is not a particular online tool that facilitates a task tracking workflow tailored for game development. Existing solutions are clumsy to use between multiple teams of specialised roles.

## End-User Requirements

The end users for this website are game studios and their employees. Specifically, this is made with the studio founded by a few people I know online in mind. These users are unhappy with their current solution which is Trello, as it is difficult effectively distribute tasks to different teams. The people who know how to 3D model do not want to be seeing each and every task related to programming. This has resulted in them having several very long task groups for different areas of work, which leads to a cluttered and unproductive workspace.
My specific end users have some other requirements. One of them suffers from colour blindness, so their input in design will be crucial for my solution to succeed. They also have a large google docs file for their game's story, which needs be seamlessly integrated into this solution.

## Proposed Solution

I intend to create a web application that allows users to create projects and invite other users to these projects. A project contains many tasks, which are organised into task groups and categories. Categories refer to areas of development, so someone specialising in one area does not have to see every task in an area they are not needed for. Creating a project will initialise it with some basic categories, such as Animation, Modelling, Programming, Writing. Within a category tasks will be in task groups
