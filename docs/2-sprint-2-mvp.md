# Sprint 2 - A Minimum Viable Product (MVP)


## Sprint Goals

Develop a bare-bones, working web application that provides the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the basis for the final phase of development in Sprint 3.

## Implemented Database Schema

For the minimal viable product, I simplified the database by removing the categories and task_groups tables, as these are not needed for the MVP. The group member of a task points directly to a project for now.

## Initial Implementation

The key functionality of the web app was implemented:
- An account system was created, prompting users to sign in or create an account before they can use the system. The home page when you are not signed in is a generic hero page, and when you are signed in it switches to list invitations and invites. You can also view other users' profiles by clicking on their icon, or edit your own profile by pressing your icon at the right of the nav bar, and selecting Profile from the drop down.
